My name is Fraser Reed and I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I'm currently a software engineer at 
[WorkshopX](http://workshopx.com), a technology incubator that has built these great brands:

        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

My expertise and interest lies in server-side technologies including PHP (including frameworks like Zend 1/2, Laravel and Slim),
MySQL, Redis, Chef, and Varnish.  I dabble in other languages like Python and Ruby and am competent in front-end tech like HTML/5, 
CSS, and JavaScript.  I am a strong believer in testing (PHPUnit) and test automation, and use TDD whenever possible.  I try to never do the
same thing twice.
