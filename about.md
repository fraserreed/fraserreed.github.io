My name is Fraser Reed and I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I'm currently a software engineer at 
[Intouch Insight Systems](https://www.intouchinsight.com) providing connected data capture and analytics solutions.

My expertise and interest lies in server-side technologies including PHP (including frameworks like Laravel, Zend 1/2 and Slim), Node.js,
MySQL, Redis, Chef, and Varnish.  I dabble in other languages like Python and Ruby and am competent in front-end tech like HTML/5, 
CSS, and JavaScript.  I am a strong believer in testing (PHPUnit) and test automation, and use TDD whenever possible.  I try to never do the same thing twice.

If you want to get in touch, send me a message through the [contact page](/contact/).
