My name is Fraser Reed and I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I'm currently the Software Development Manager at 
[Postmedia Network Inc.](https://www.postmedia.com/){:target="_blank"} where I lead technical architecture and development for sites used
 to provide media content to readers across Canada and the world.

My expertise and interest lies in server-side technologies including PHP (including frameworks like Laravel, Zend and Slim), Python (Django),
MySQL, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, Docker, Chef, and Varnish.  I dabble in other languages like R and Ruby and am competent in front-end 
tech like JavaScript/Typescript, HTML and CSS.  I am a strong believer in testing (PHPUnit, pytest) and test automation, and use TDD whenever 
possible. I try to never do the same thing twice.

If you want to get in touch, send me a message through the [contact page](/contact/).
