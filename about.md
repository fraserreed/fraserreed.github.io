My name is Fraser Reed and I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I'm currently the Software Development Manager at
[Neptune Retail Solutions](https://www.neptuneretailsolutions.com/){:target="_blank"} where I lead the engineering team
for our omni-channel marketing API, used by our customers to create and distribute cashback offers into our
network of retailer loyalty programs and 3rd party cashback apps.

My expertise and interest lies in server-side technologies including PHP (including frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Zend and Slim), Python (Django),
MySQL, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, Docker, Chef, and Varnish.  I dabble in other languages like R and Ruby and am competent in front-end
tech like JavaScript/Typescript, HTML and CSS.  I am a strong believer in testing (PHPUnit, pytest) and test automation, and use TDD whenever
possible. I try to never do the same thing twice.
